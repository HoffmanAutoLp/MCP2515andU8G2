10/7/24 9:20 pm latest commit to the truck Pids project using mcp2515. in this code ive changed sampling rate to every 15ms and changed the "error sending message" to be off for the time being, uncomment on for troubleshooting. the pids print in with this code on a new line reading "RPM xxxx" and "ECT xxx". this is the last commit hopefully before using it with the ssd1309 display, which will be in another folder to avoid confusion.
